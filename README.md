This study analyzes the Enron Email Dataset to track how communication evolved across hierarchy levels before collapse. Using SVM and Gradient Boosting, we predict sender level from linguistic features, then apply sentiment and topic modeling (LDA, BERTopic) to reveal emotional and thematic shifts linked to Enronâ€™s downfall.
